# Day 87 - Coffee and Wi-fi site

This site created displays a list of cafes and information about them (their location, whether toilets/Wi-Fi/power sockets are available, the price of a coffee, etc) and allows visitors to add new cafes and edit cafe information. It also allows those who know the "secret password" to delete cafes (this is based of the implementation of the API key in day 66 - that could have been implemented using accounts).

The code is mostly from that I created in days 62 (create a cafe site with data loaded from a .csv file) and 66 (create an API using an SQL database) of the course, with a few additions (including skills learned from searching and/or later days of the course). The site template was originally taken from the course but has been updated (and downgraded) to the site basic template, as is used across these projects and sites. The path layouts are similar to that of day 67, where the blog project was designed RESTfully.
