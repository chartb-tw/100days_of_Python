# Day 87 - Coffee and Wi-fi site

This site created displays a list of cafes and information about them (their location, whether toilets/Wi-Fi/power sockets are available, the price of a coffee, etc) and allows visitors to add new cafes and edit cafe information. It also allows those who know the "secret password" to delete cafes (this is based of the implementation of the API key in day 66 - that could have been implemented using accounts).

The code is mostly from that I created in days 62 (create a cafe site with data loaded from a .csv file) and 66 (create an API using an SQL database) of the course, with a few additions (including skills learned from searching and/or later days of the course). The site template is taken from the starting file from day 62.

(Looking back, I'm not entirely sure whether the site should have interfaced with the database directly as in my code here, or whether it was supposed to use an API created to interact with it. However, as I [already know how to use APIs for the most part](https://github.com/chartb-tw/100days_of_Python/tree/main/day95), I'm not going to sweat too much over it.)
