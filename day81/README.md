# Text to morse code program

This is broken into two parts:
1. Me trying to find a way to get a Python dictionary of Morse code characters (with me being too lazy to search any more than a simple query or to copy them manually, but apparently not lazy enough to go through the effort of scraping them from a site and saving the outputs in various formats)
2. The script itself, which takes in a string and converts the characters that it had listed (at the moment alphanumeric characters only - as in the alphabetic characters and numeric digits).

Of course, this nicely paid out by giving me [another day's project] for ["damn near free"!]
