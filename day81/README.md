# Text to morse code program

This is broken into two parts:
1. Me trying to find a way to get a Python dictionary of Morse code characters (with me being too lazy to search any more than a simple query or to copy them manually, but apparently not lazy enough to go through the effort of scraping them from a site and saving the outputs in various formats)
2. The script itself, which takes in a string and converts the characters that it had listed (at the moment alphanumeric characters only - as in the alphabetic characters and numeric digits).

Of course, this nicely paid out by giving me [another day's project](https://github.com/chartb-tw/100days_of_Python/tree/main/day92) for "damn near free"! (If you know that reference, you're a legend btw)

Run the program [from here](https://replit.com/@chartb/100daysofPythonday81) to test it out!
