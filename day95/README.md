## The RealTimeTrains API copy site

This site uses the [RealtimeTrains API](https://www.realtimetrains.co.uk/about/developer/) and is designed around two (accessbile) pages. The first is the homepage, and the second fetches data on train departures based on the [CRS or TIPLOC code](http://www.railwaycodes.org.uk/crs/crs0.shtm) being passed in.

This was made as a "quick and easy" solution for the day 95 exercise of the course, and uses the basic template that I had designed. The site hasn't been set up to handle exceptions well (nor do I really intend on adding that functionality, unless it comes as part of learning something I need to).

Hopefully it serves as an example of how to use APIs and the responses that are gained from them!
