# Tic-tac-toe game

This is a version of tic-tac-toe, with the ability to chose custom characters (any alphanumeric character or emoji would work!). There are two files, one which contains a class for the "board" and the other with the game's logic.

Run the program [from here](https://replit.com/@chartb/100daysofPythonday83) to test it!
