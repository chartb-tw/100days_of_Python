# Watermark app

This is a tkinter based GUI program that takes an image and a watermark, and applies the watermark to the file. The method I used was inspired from a similar one I had learned and implemented in C++, in the [Object Oriented Structures Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-fundamentals-1#about).
The watermark image is basically required to be black and (pure) white, with the areas of pure white being used to create the watermark. (Yes, I know there are limitations to that...)

The app really could have been designed better too, but I was too lazy once again (besides, that's just reading the documentation!)
